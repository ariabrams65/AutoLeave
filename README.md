AutoLeave allows you to instantly leave matches and automatically queue

## How is this different from other plugins such as InstantSuite and PremierSuite?
AutoLeave instantly leaves the match as soon as it is possible to do so. No having to wait for replays to end.

## Important
Plugins such as InstantSuite and PremierSuite must be disabled

## Keybinds
Go to the `keybinds` menu in BakkesMod to set the following keybinds:
* `toggleAutoLeave` toggles the plugin on and off
* `leaveMatch` leave match with keybind (AutoLeave must be toggled off)
